## Proxies

You will have to use HQ Proxies/IPs to get Unlocked Tokens.
If you really want to generate proxies, you maight have to spend fairly big amounts of money, to get undetected/unflagged IPs.
If you just want to test the Generator, you can also just restart your InternetRouter (if you have a rotating IP) and Discord wont notice.

(Btw your Proxy AD can stand here, DM me for offers ;d ;:D)
